I am a graduate student in John Wakeley's group_ in the Department of
`Organismic and Evolutionary Biology`_ at Harvard University. You can reach me at
pwilton@fas.harvard.edu.

I study theoretical population genetics. I am interested in developing models
that can be used to infer evolutionary and demographic history from patterns of
genetic variation. Right now I am working in two areas: 

#. sequentially Markov coalescent models and related methods and
#. population pedigrees and their effect on the coalescent process and genetic
   variation.

Software
=========

`Pedigree simulator <https://github.com/ammodramus/coalped>`_
  A program to simulate coalescence through randomly-generated population
  pedigrees. The simulator can accommodate variable population sizes, multiples
  demes, variable migration rates, and other features. The program can output
  distributions of pairwise coalescence times, and it can output infinite-alleles
  and infinite-sites mutation data in a variety of formats.

`Infinite-sites likelihood calculator <https://github.com/ammodramus/infsites>`_
  Calculates sampling probabilities under the infinite-sites mutation model in
  a single- or two-deme setting. Uses the method of `Wu (2010)
  <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5383348>`__.

Teaching
========

Statistics for Biologists (Fall 2014)
 I was a teaching assistant for OEB 153, `Statistics for
 Biologists <http://isites.harvard.edu/course/colgsas-49559>`__. For the course
 I created a series of labs introducing the `R <http://www.r-project.org/>`__ statistical
 computing environment. The labs are available on `github
 <https://github.com/ammodramus/R-labs>`__.

Coalescent Theory (Fall 2012)
 I was a teaching assistant for OEB 252, Coalescent Theory,
 a graduate-level course.
